  <h1>Helllo World!</h1>
  <p>We have not told Git the location of the “origin” repository. We’ve initialized a new repository using “git init” and so our repository is not linked to any remote repository by default.

    To fix this error, we need to manually tell Git where the remote version of our repository exists. Do this using the git remote add command:
    
    git remote add origin https://github.com/career-karma-tutorials/ck-git
    
    This command tells Git the remote called “origin” should be associated with a particular URL. Git now knows where the remote version of our repository exists.
    
    Let’s try to push our code again:
    
    git push origin master
    
    The Git command line successfully pushes our code to our remote repository.</p>
